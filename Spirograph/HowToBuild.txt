How To Build
------------

1. install Node.js
    a. note: this project only seems to build correctly with version 5 and lower, due to this issue: https://github.com/cgross/grunt-dom-munger/issues/42.  Removing the 'isPath' parameter makes the build produce incorrect results.
2. install Grunt and Bower
3. run 'npm install' and 'bower install' inside /Spirograph directory
4. change the value '@fa-font-path' in /bower_components/fontawesome/less/variables.less from "../fonts" to "./"
    a. do the same for the bower_components directory in /gallery
5. install WebEssentials VS plugin
6. build and run!
7. create a distribution build, runt 'grunt' inside the /Spirograph directory


How To Publish
--------------

1. after building (see above), run 'npm publish' from the ./dist directory
    a. don't run this command from the /Spirograph directory!
